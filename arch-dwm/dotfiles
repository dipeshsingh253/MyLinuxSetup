# setting up the brightness

two options you can see the directory sys/class/backlight

I will have to know more abouth the root file system.

then you can use xbacklight command to control brightness, but by default only root can perform this action, users  must be add udev rules to do this find more info on this archwiki

also the second way to use light command in this case you will have to add user to video group using usermod command and then you can use light commands to control brightness.
